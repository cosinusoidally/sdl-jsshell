Just a couple of ideas for how to improve the voxelspace.js demo:

Load and decode the real demo maps included with the Comanche game demo. This
would mean converting
https://github.com/s-macke/VoxelSpace/blob/master/tools/comanche2extract/extract.c
to JS so that we can just decode and load the DTA files from disk. The benefit
of doing this is that we will not have to rely on the png versions hosted by
s-macke. We can instead grab the demo version of Comanche from archive.org (or
wherever) and then just extract the DTA files (C1.DTA and D1.DTA) from that
(demo is available from archive.org here:
https://archive.org/details/ComancheMaximumOverkill_1020 ).
